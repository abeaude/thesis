### 1. Survival Function

The survival function, denoted as \(S(t)\), represents the probability of an individual or item surviving past time \(t\). Mathematically, it's defined as:
\[S(t) = P(T > t)\]
where \(T\) is the random variable representing the survival time.

### 2. Hazard Function

The hazard function, \(\lambda(t)\), is another core concept in survival analysis and represents the instantaneous rate of occurrence of the event of interest at time \(t\), given that the event has not occurred until \(t\). It is defined as:
\[\lambda(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P(t \leq T < t + \Delta t | T \geq t)}{\Delta t}\]
This function is crucial for understanding the risk of the event happening at different times.

### 3. Cumulative Hazard Function

The cumulative hazard function, \(\Lambda(t)\), integrates the hazard function over time and provides a cumulative measure of risk up to time \(t\):
\[\Lambda(t) = \int_0^t \lambda(u) du\]
It offers a way to quantify the accumulated risk of the event occurring over time.

### 4. Cox Proportional Hazards Model

One of the most commonly used models in survival analysis is the Cox proportional hazards model. It models the hazard at a certain time for an individual as a product of a baseline hazard function, which is the same for all individuals, and a function of individual covariates:
\[\lambda(t | x) = \lambda_0(t) \exp(\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_px_p)\]
where \(x_i\) represents the covariates or features (e.g., age, treatment group), \(\beta_i\) are the coefficients that measure the impact of covariates, and \(\lambda_0(t)\) is the baseline hazard.
