  abstract       = {Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to its widespread industrial adoption, with machine learning systems demonstrating superhuman performance in a significant number of tasks. However, this surge in performance, has often been achieved through increased model complexity, turning such systems into &ldquo;black box&rdquo; approaches and causing uncertainty regarding the way they operate and, ultimately, the way that they come to decisions. This ambiguity has made it problematic for machine learning systems to be adopted in sensitive yet critical domains, where their value could be immense, such as healthcare. As a result, scientific interest in the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), a field that is concerned with the development of new methods that explain and interpret machine learning models, has been tremendously reignited over recent years. This study focuses on machine learning interpretability methods; more specifically, a literature review and taxonomy of these methods are presented, as well as links to their programming implementations, in the hope that this survey would serve as a reference point for both theorists and practitioners.},

  abstract     = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} With the rapid advancement of genomic sequencing techniques, massive production of gene expression data is becoming possible, which prompts the development of precision medicine. Deep learning is a promising approach for phenotype prediction (clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response) based on gene expression profile. Existing deep learning models are usually considered as black-boxes that provide accurate predictions but are not interpretable. However, accuracy and interpretation are both essential for precision medicine. In addition, most models do not integrate the knowledge of the domain. Hence, making deep learning models interpretable for medical applications using prior biological knowledge is the main focus of this paper. Results:\hspace{0.6em} In this paper, we propose a new self-explainable deep learning model, called Deep GONet, integrating the Gene Ontology into the hierarchical architecture of the neural network. This model is based on a fully-connected architecture constrained by the Gene Ontology annotations, such that each neuron represents a biological function. The experiments on cancer diagnosis datasets demonstrate that Deep GONet is both easily interpretable and highly performant to discriminate cancer and non-cancer samples. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Our model provides an explanation to its predictions by identifying the most important neurons and associating them with biological functions, making the model understandable for biologists and physicians.},

  abstract = {DNA Methylation has been the most extensively studied epigenetic mark. Usually a change in the genotype, DNA sequence, leads to a change in the phenotype, observable characteristics of the individual. But DNA methylation, which happens in the context of CpG (cytosine and guanine bases linked by phosphate backbone) dinucleotides, does not lead to a change in the original DNA sequence, but has the potential to change the phenotype. DNA methylation is implicated in various biological processes and diseases including cancer. Hence there is a strong interest in understanding the DNA methylation patterns across various epigenetic related ailments in order to distinguish and diagnose the type of disease in its early stages. In this work, the relationship between methylated versus unmethylated CpG regions and cancer types is explored using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A CNN based Deep Learning model that can classify the cancer of a new DNA methylation profile based on the learning from publicly available DNA methylation datasets is then proposed.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP), representing approximately 3-5\% of all malignancies, is defined as metastatic cancer where a primary site of origin cannot be found despite a standard diagnostic workup. Because knowledge of a patient's primary cancer remains fundamental to their treatment, CUP patients are significantly disadvantaged and most have a poor survival outcome. Developing robust and accessible diagnostic methods for resolving cancer tissue of origin, therefore, has significant value for CUP patients. METHODS: We developed an RNA-based classifier called CUP-AI-Dx that utilizes a 1D Inception convolutional neural network (1D-Inception) model to infer a tumor's primary tissue of origin. CUP-AI-Dx was trained using the transcriptional profiles of 18,217 primary tumours representing 32 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Gene expression data was ordered by gene chromosomal coordinates as input to the 1D-CNN model, and the model utilizes multiple convolutional kernels with different configurations simultaneously to improve generality. The model was optimized through extensive hyperparameter tuning, including different max-pooling layers and dropout settings. For 11 tumour types, we also developed a random forest model that can classify the tumour's molecular subtype according to prior TCGA studies. The optimised CUP-AI-Dx tissue of origin classifier was tested on 394 metastatic samples from 11 tumour types from TCGA and 92 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples representing 18 cancer types from two clinical laboratories. The CUP-AI-Dx molecular subtype was also independently tested on independent ovarian and breast cancer microarray datasets FINDINGS: CUP-AI-Dx identifies the primary site with an overall top-1-accuracy of 98.54\% in cross-validation and 96.70\% on a test dataset. When applied to two independent clinical-grade RNA-seq datasets generated from two different institutes from the US and Australia, our model predicted the primary site with a top-1-accuracy of 86.96\% and 72.46\% respectively. INTERPRETATION: The CUP-AI-Dx predicts tumour primary site and molecular subtype with high accuracy and therefore can be used to assist the diagnostic work-up of cancers of unknown primary or uncertain origin using a common and accessible genomics platform.

  abstract     = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Despite remarkable advances in cancer research, cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection of cancer and localization of the tissue of its origin are key to effective treatment. Here, we leverage technological advances in machine learning or artificial intelligence to design a novel framework for cancer diagnostics. Our proposed framework detects cancers and their tissues of origin using a unified model of cancers encompassing 33 cancers represented in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our model exploits the learned features of different cancers reflected in the respective dysregulated epigenomes, which arise early in carcinogenesis and differ remarkably between different cancer types or subtypes, thus holding a great promise in early cancer detection. Results:\hspace{0.6em} Our comprehensive assessment of the proposed model on the 33 different tissues of origin demonstrates its ability to detect and classify cancers to a high accuracy ({$>$}\,99\% overall F-measure). Furthermore, our model distinguishes cancers from pre-cancerous lesions to metastatic tumors and discriminates between hypomethylation changes due to age related epigenetic drift and true cancer. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Beyond detection of primary cancers, our proposed computational model also robustly detects tissues of origin of secondary cancers, including metastatic cancers, second primary cancers, and cancers of unknown primaries. Our assessment revealed the ability of this model to characterize pre-cancer samples, a significant step forward in early cancer detection. Deployed broadly this model can deliver accurate diagnosis for a greatly expanded target patient population.},

  abstract     = {While estimating the prognosis of low-grade glioma (LGG) is a crucial problem, it has not been extensively studied to introduce recent improvements in deep learning to address the problem. The attention mechanism is one of the significant advances; however, it is still unclear how attention mechanisms are used in gene expression data to estimate prognosis because they were designed for convolutional layers and word embeddings. This paper proposes an attention mechanism called gene attention for gene expression data. Additionally, a deep learning model for prognosis estimation of LGG is proposed using gene attention. The proposed Gene Attention Ensemble NETwork (GAENET) outperformed other conventional methods, including survival support vector machine and random survival forest. When evaluated by C-Index, the GAENET exhibited an improvement of 7.2\% compared to the second-best model. In addition, taking advantage of the gene attention mechanism, HILS1 was discovered as the most significant prognostic gene in terms of deep learning training. While HILS1 is known as a pseudogene, HILS1 is a biomarker estimating the prognosis of LGG and has demonstrated a possibility of regulating the expression of other prognostic genes.},

  abstract     = {Background: Cancer has been a leading cause of death in the United States with significant health care costs. Accurate prediction of cancers at an early stage and understanding the genomic mechanisms that drive cancer development are vital to the improvement of treatment outcomes and survival rates, thus resulting in significant social and economic impacts. Attempts have been made to classify cancer types with machine learning techniques during the past two decades and deep learning approaches more recently.Results: In this paper, we established four models with graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) that use unstructured gene expressions as inputs to classify different tumor and non-tumor samples into their designated 33 cancer types or as normal. Four GCNN models based on a co-expression graph, co-expression+singleton graph, protein-protein interaction (PPI) graph, and PPI+singleton graph have been designed and implemented. They were trained and tested on combined 10,340 cancer samples and 731 normal tissue samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The established GCNN models achieved excellent prediction accuracies (89.9–94.7\%) among 34 classes (33 cancer types and a normal group). In silico gene-perturbation experiments were performed on four models based on co-expression graph, co-expression+singleton, PPI graph, and PPI+singleton graphs. The co-expression GCNN model was further interpreted to identify a total of 428 marker genes that drive the classification of 33 cancer types and normal. The concordance of differential expressions of these markers between the represented cancer type and others are confirmed. Successful classification of cancer types and a normal group regardless of normal tissues' origin suggested that the identified markers are cancer-specific rather than tissue-specific.Conclusion: Novel GCNN models have been established to predict cancer types or normal tissue based on gene expression profiles. We demonstrated the results from the TCGA dataset that these models can produce accurate classification (above 94\%), using cancer-specific markers genes. The models and the source codes are publicly available and can be readily adapted to the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases by the data-driven modeling research community.},

The available gene expression data has a small number of samples and a relatively big number of dimensions, and that makes it not suitable for deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures, which exhibit state-of-the-art performance in many fields. In this paper, we propose a lightweight CNN architecture for breast cancer classification using gene expression data downloaded from Pan-Cancer Atlas using “Illumina HiSeq” platform. The downloaded gene expression data is preprocessed and then transformed into 2D-images. We started the preprocessing by removing the outlier samples, which are determined based on the Array-Array Intensity Correlation (AAIC), which defines a symmetric square matrix of Spearman correlation. Then we applied a normalization process on the gene expression data to ensure that we can infer the expression level from it correctly and avoid biases in the expression measures. Finally, filtering is applied on the data. Model selection or a parameters search strategy is conducted to choose the values of the CNN hyper-parameters that give optimal performance. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.76\%, which is the highest compared to other competing methods.},

  abstract = {Differential analysis occupies the most significant portion of the standard practices of RNA-Seq analysis. However, the conventional method is matching the tumor samples to the normal samples, which are both from the same tumor type. The output using such method would fail in differentiating tumor types because it lacks the knowledge from other tumor types. Pan-Cancer Atlas provides us with abundant information on 33 prevalent tumor types which could be used as prior knowledge to generate tumor-specific biomarkers. In this paper, we embedded the high dimensional RNA-Seq data into 2-D images and used a convolutional neural network to make classification of the 33 tumor types. The final accuracy we got was 95.59\%, higher than another paper applying GA/KNN method on the same dataset. Based on the idea of Guided Grad Cam, as to each class, we generated significance heat-map for all the genes. By doing functional analysis on the genes with high intensities in the heat-maps, we validated that these top genes are related to tumorspecific pathways, and some of them have already been used as biomarkers, which proved the effectiveness of our method. As far as we know, we are the first to apply convolutional neural network on Pan-Cancer Atlas for classification, and we are also the first to match the significance of classification with the importance of genes. Our experiment results show that our method has a good performance and could also apply in other genomics data.},

  abstract     = {The survival rate of cancer has increased significantly during the past two decades for breast, prostate, testicular, and colon cancer, while the brain and pancreatic cancers have a much lower median survival rate that has not improved much over the last forty years. This has imposed the challenge of finding gene markers for early cancer detection and treatment strategies. Different methods including regression-based Cox-PH, artificial neural networks, and recently deep learning algorithms have been proposed to predict the survival rate for cancers. We established in this work a novel graph convolution neural network (GCNN) approach called Surv\_GCNN to predict the survival rate for 13 different cancer types using the TCGA dataset. For each cancer type, 6 Surv\_GCNN models with graphs generated by correlation analysis, GeneMania database, and correlation~+~GeneMania were trained with and without clinical data to predict the risk score (RS). The performance of the 6 Surv\_GCNN models was compared with two other existing models, Cox-PH and Cox-nnet. The results showed that Cox-PH has the worst performance among 8 tested models across the 13 cancer types while Surv\_GCNN models with clinical data reported the best overall performance, outperforming other competing models in 7 out of 13 cancer types including BLCA, BRCA, COAD, LUSC, SARC, STAD, and UCEC. A novel network-based interpretation of Surv\_GCNN was also proposed to identify potential gene markers for breast cancer. The signatures learned by the nodes in the hidden layer of Surv\_GCNN were identified and were linked to potential gene markers by network modularization. The identified gene markers for breast cancer have been compared to a total of 213 gene markers from three widely cited lists for breast cancer survival analysis. About 57\% of gene markers obtained by Surv\_GCNN with correlation~+~GeneMania graph either overlap or directly interact with the 213 genes, confirming the effectiveness of the identified markers by Surv\_GCNN.},

  abstract     = {Molecular subtyping of cancer is a critical step towards more individualized therapy and provides important biological insights into cancer heterogeneity. Although gene expression signature-based classification has been widely demonstrated to be an effective approach in the last decade, the widespread implementation has long been limited by platform differences, batch effects, and the difficulty to classify individual patient samples. Here, we describe a novel supervised cancer classification framework, deep cancer subtype classification (DeepCC), based on deep learning of functional spectra quantifying activities of biological pathways. In two case studies about colorectal and breast cancer classification, DeepCC classifiers and DeepCC single sample predictors both achieved overall higher sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy compared with other widely used classification methods such as random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and multinomial logistic regression algorithms. Simulation analysis based on random subsampling of genes demonstrated the robustness of DeepCC to missing data. Moreover, deep features learned by DeepCC captured biological characteristics associated with distinct molecular subtypes, enabling more compact within-subtype distribution and between-subtype separation of patient samples, and therefore greatly reduce the number of unclassifiable samples previously. In summary, DeepCC provides a novel cancer classification framework that is platform independent, robust to missing data, and can be used for single sample prediction facilitating clinical implementation of cancer molecular subtyping.},

We trained the ANNs using the small, round blue-cell tumors (SRBCTs) as a model. These cancers belong to four distinct diagnostic categories and often present diagnostic dilemmas in clinical practice. The ANNs correctly classified all samples and identified the genes most relevant to the classification. Expression of several of these genes has been reported in SRBCTs, but most have not been associated with these cancers. To test the ability of the trained ANN models to recognize SRBCTs, we analyzed additional blinded samples that were not previously used for the training procedure, and correctly classified them in all cases. This study demonstrates the potential applications of these methods for tumor diagnosis and the identification of candidate targets for therapy.},

  abstract     = {Ribonucleic acid Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis is particularly useful for obtaining insights into differentially expressed genes. However, it is challenging because of its high-dimensional data. Such analysis is a tool with which to find underlying patterns in data, e.g., for cancer specific biomarkers. In the past, analyses were performed on RNA-Seq data pertaining to the same cancer class as positive and negative samples, i.e., without samples of other cancer types. To perform multiple cancer type classification and to find differentially expressed genes, data for multiple cancer types need to be analyzed. Several repositories offer RNA-Seq data for various cancer types. In this paper, data from the Mendeley data repository for five cancer types are analyzed. As a first step, RNA-Seq values are converted to 2D images using normalization and zero padding. In the next step, relevant features are extracted and selected using Deep Learning (DL). In the last phase, classification is performed, and eight DL algorithms are used. Results and discussion are based on four different splitting strategies and k-fold cross validation for each DL classifier. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is performed with state of the art techniques discussed in literature. The results demonstrated that classifiers performed best at 70–30 split, and that Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the best overall results. Hence, CNN is the best DL model for classification among the eight studied DL models, and is easy to implement and simple to understand.},

  abstract     = {Background: Deep learning has made tremendous successes in numerous artificial intelligence applications and is unsurprisingly penetrating into various biomedical domains. High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices, such as transcriptomes and metabolomes, have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Results: Using 37 high throughput omics datasets, covering transcriptomes and metabolomes, we evaluated the classification power of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods. Representative deep learning methods, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were deployed and explored in seeking optimal architectures for the best classification performance. Together with five classical supervised classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), MLP and CNN were comparatively tested on the 37 datasets to predict disease stages or to discriminate diseased samples from normal samples. MLPs achieved the highest overall accuracy among all methods tested. More thorough analyses revealed that single hidden layer MLPs with ample hidden units outperformed deeper MLPs. Furthermore, MLP was one of the most robust methods against imbalanced class composition and inaccurate class labels. Conclusion: Our results concluded that shallow MLPs (of one or two hidden layers) with ample hidden neurons are sufficient to achieve superior and robust classification performance in exploiting numerical matrix-formed omics data for diagnosis purpose. Specific observations regarding optimal network width, class imbalance tolerance, and inaccurate labeling tolerance will inform future improvement of neural network applications on functional genomics data.},

  abstract     = {Abstract                            Background               Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis and therapy. Through a predictive model,~important cancer marker genes can be inferred. Several studies have attempted to build machine learning models for this task however none has taken into consideration the effects of tissue of origin that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers.                                         Results                                In this paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and tested on gene expression profiles from~combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and~713 matched normal tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent prediction accuracies (93.9–95.0\%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal). Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, 1D-CNN model, with a guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2090 cancer markers (108 per class~on average). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as                 GATA3                 and                 ESR1                 . Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for the~prediction of breast cancer subtypes and achieved an average accuracy of 88.42\% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be found at~                 https://github.com/chenlabgccri/CancerTypePrediction                 .                                                        Conclusions               Here we present novel CNN designs for accurate and simultaneous cancer/normal and cancer types prediction based on gene expression profiles, and unique model interpretation scheme to elucidate biologically relevance of cancer marker genes after eliminating the effects of tissue-of-origin. The proposed model has light hyperparameters to be trained and thus can be easily adapted to facilitate cancer diagnosis in the future.},

However, few studies have tried to identify DNA methylation markers to diagnose diverse cancer types simultaneously, i.e., pan-cancers. In this study, we tried to identify DNA methylation markers to differentiate cancer samples from the respective normal samples in pan-cancers. We collected whole genome methylation data of 27 cancer types containing 10,140 cancer samples and 3386 normal samples, and divided all samples into five data sets, including one training data set, one validation data set and three test data sets. We applied machine learning to identify DNA methylation markers, and specifically, we constructed diagnostic prediction models by deep learning. We identified two categories of markers: 12 CpG markers and 13 promoter markers. Three of 12 CpG markers and four of 13 promoter markers locate at cancer-related genes. With the CpG markers, our model achieved an average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets as 92.8\% and 90.1\%, respectively. For promoter markers, the average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets were 89.8\% and 81.1\%, respectively. Furthermore, in cell-free DNA methylation data of 163 prostate cancer samples, the CpG markers achieved the sensitivity as 100\%, and the promoter markers achieved 92\%. For both marker types, the specificity of normal whole blood was 100\%. To conclude, we identified methylation markers to diagnose pan-cancers, which might be applied to liquid biopsy of cancers.},

  abstract      = {Adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma constitute approximately 40\% and 30\% of all lung cancer subtypes, respectively, and display broad heterogeneity in terms of clinical and molecular responses to therapy. Molecular subtyping has enabled precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide significant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical decision making. Over the past decade, conventional ML algorithms and DL-based CNNs have been espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene expression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward identification of cancer biomarkers. Recently proposed transformer-based architectures that leverage the self-attention mechanism encode high throughput gene expressions and learn representations that are computationally complex and parametrically expensive. However, compared to the datasets for natural language processing applications, gene expression consists of several hundreds of thousands of genes from a limited number of observations, making it difficult to efficiently train transformers for bioinformatics applications. Hence, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, Gene Transformer, which addresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head self-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer subtypes without requiring feature selection as a prerequisite for the current classification algorithms. The proposed architecture achieved an overall improved performance for all evaluation metrics and had fewer misclassification errors than the commonly used traditional classification algorithms. The classification results show that Gene Transformer can be an efficient approach for classifying cancer subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep learning models in computational biology can also be reflected well in this domain.},

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires \$O(n\^2)\$ memory. While the time complexity is still \$O(n\^2)\$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires \$O(\textbackslash sqrt\{n\})\$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.},

A large reason for this is that self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which in turn, scales quadratically with the image size. On larger images (e.g., 1080p), over 60\% of the total computation in the network is spent solely on creating and applying attention matrices. We take a step toward solving this issue by introducing Hydra Attention, an extremely efficient attention operation for Vision Transformers (ViTs). Paradoxically, this efficiency comes from taking multi-head attention to its extreme: by using as many attention heads as there are features, Hydra Attention is computationally linear in both tokens and features with no hidden constants, making it significantly faster than standard self-attention in an off-the-shelf ViT-B/16 by a factor of the token count. Moreover, Hydra Attention retains high accuracy on ImageNet and, in some cases, actually improves it.},

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\textbackslash "\{o\}mformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\textbackslash "\{o\}m method to approximate standard self-attention with \$O(n)\$ complexity. The scalability of Nystr\textbackslash "\{o\}mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\textbackslash "\{o\}mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\textbackslash "\{o\}mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Understanding how cancer utilizes these developmental pathways in acquiring the resistance to the multi-therapeutic approach cancer can give rise to a new insight of the anti-therapy resistance mechanisms, which can be explored for the development of a novel therapeutic approach. We present a brief overview of Notch, Hedgehog, and Wnt signaling pathways in cancer and its role in providing resistance to various cancer treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Understanding the importance of these molecular networks will provide a rational basis for novel and safer combined anticancer therapeutic approaches for the improvement of cancer treatment by overcoming drug resistance.},

However, infection with this agent, although needed, is not sufficient for a cancer to develop. Additional cellular changes are required to complement the action of HPV, but the precise nature of these changes is not clear. Here, we studied the function of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway in cervical cancer. The Hh pathway can have a role in a number of cancers, including those of liver, lung and digestive tract. We found that components of the Hh pathway are expressed in several cervical cancer cell lines, indicating that there could exists an autocrine Hh signaling loop in these cells. Inhibition of Hh signaling reduces proliferation and survival of the cervical cancer cells and induces their apoptosis as seen by the up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein cleaved caspase 3. Our results indicate that Hh signaling is not induced directly by HPV-encoded proteins but rather that Hh-activating mutations are selected in cells initially immortalized by HPV. Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ligand induces proliferation and promotes migration of the cervical cancer cells studied. Together, these results indicate pro-survival and protective roles of an activated Hh signaling pathway in cervical cancer-derived cells, and suggest that inhibition of this pathway may be a therapeutic option in fighting cervical cancer.},

  abstract     = {Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common malignant cancer in women. CC is difficult to diagnose, has a high recurrence rate, and is resistant to systemic therapies; as a result, CC patients have a relatively poor prognosis. One potential link to CC is the Wnt signaling pathway and its downstream effectors, which regulate cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, and fate. The aberrant activation of Wnt signaling is associated with various cancers, including CC. Recent studies have shown that activating or inhibiting the intracellular signal transduction in this pathway can regulate cancer cell growth and viability. This review will summarize the experimental evidence supporting the significance of the Wnt signaling pathway in CC, and will also discuss the current clinical role of Wnt signaling in CC diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis.},

  abstract     = {Cancer has been characterized as a heterogeneous disease consisting of many different subtypes. The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

  abstract      = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract     = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

  abstract     = {For cancer diagnosis, many DNA methylation markers have been identified. However, few studies have tried to identify DNA methylation markers to diagnose diverse cancer types simultaneously, i.e., pan-cancers. In this study, we tried to identify DNA methylation markers to differentiate cancer samples from the respective normal samples in pan-cancers. We collected whole genome methylation data of 27 cancer types containing 10,140 cancer samples and 3386 normal samples, and divided all samples into five data sets, including one training data set, one validation data set and three test data sets. We applied machine learning to identify DNA methylation markers, and specifically, we constructed diagnostic prediction models by deep learning. We identified two categories of markers: 12 CpG markers and 13 promoter markers. Three of 12 CpG markers and four of 13 promoter markers locate at cancer-related genes. With the CpG markers, our model achieved an average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets as 92.8\% and 90.1\%, respectively. For promoter markers, the average sensitivity and specificity on test data sets were 89.8\% and 81.1\%, respectively. Furthermore, in cell-free DNA methylation data of 163 prostate cancer samples, the CpG markers achieved the sensitivity as 100\%, and the promoter markers achieved 92\%. For both marker types, the specificity of normal whole blood was 100\%. To conclude, we identified methylation markers to diagnose pan-cancers, which might be applied to liquid biopsy of cancers.},

  abstract  = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
