\chapter{Deep-learning for omics data analysis}\label{chap:sota}
\minitocpage

\section{Unimodal}
architectures tested on omics data, what are the tasks, what are they able to achieve

\section{Multimodal}
what is multimodal, how  to do it, common vocab
is there an advantage
are there any challenges, specific to omics

show some example on omics data

\section{Model interpretability}
general about interpretability/explanability
fix the vocabulary that is used
present different methods, advantage drawbacks

way to introduce counterfactuals

remind what are counterfactuals in plain english: what if
show equation
desired property of CFs + construct the optimization problem
how to solve it: gradient descent show algo
discuss lambda
show some methods

need to talk about adversarial examples, details in annex?
how to have a model robust to adv attacks, defenses, adv training
