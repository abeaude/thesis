\section{Deep-Learning models}
 In this section, I will introduce the main deep learning architectures used for discriminative tasks: \glsxtrfull{mlp}, \glsxtrfull{cnn}, \glsxtrfull{gnn}.
 The work of this thesis relies on the application of the attention mechanism, therefore I will detail the attention mechanism and its usage in the transformer architecture.
 I will also describe the \glsxtrfull{ae} and its probabilistic variant the \glsxtrfull{vae} as they are commonly used in the literature to study omics data.
 Finally, I will present the \glsxtrfull{gan} architecture which is used in some of the work in this thesis.

 Let \(\symbf{x}\) be the input and \(y \in \left\{1,2, \cdots, C \right\} \) the associated label, where \(C\) is the number of classes.
 The dimension of \(\symbf{x}\) will be specified in each of the architecture described.
 For discriminative tasks the goal is to return a prediction \(\hat{y} \in \left[0,1\right]^C\).

 This section does not presume to be a complete presentation of cancer biology, but aims to provide the necessary keys to understand cancer origins and the different molecular components involved.
 present normal function of a cell with various components, DNA to protein in a cell. Protein = structure = function.
 How this process is regulated: present central dogma, cell regulation
 cancer = dysregulation of the functionning of a cell.
 origin: multiscale, can happens at diferent place of the process.
 talk about cancer hallmarks

 cancer origin, promotion, growth metastasis = dvt of cancer
