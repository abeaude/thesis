  abstract  = {{The increasing availability of high-throughput omics data allows for considering a new medicine centered on individual patients. Precision medicine relies on exploiting these high-throughput data with machine-learning models, especially the ones based on deep-learning approaches, to improve diagnosis. Due to the high-dimensional small-sample nature of omics data, current deep-learning models end up with many parameters and have to be fitted with a limited training set. Furthermore, interactions between molecular entities inside an omics profile are not patient specific but are the same for all patients.In this article, we propose AttOmics, a new deep-learning architecture based on the self-attention mechanism. First, we decompose each omics profile into a set of groups, where each group contains related features. Then, by applying the self-attention mechanism to the set of groups, we can capture the different interactions specific to a patient. The results of different experiments carried out in this article show that our model can accurately predict the phenotype of a patient with fewer parameters than deep neural networks. Visualizing the attention maps can provide new insights into the essential groups for a particular phenotype.}},

  abstract  = {{Advances in high throughput technologies enabled large access to various types of omics. Each omics provides a partial view of the underlying biological process. Integrating multiple omics layers would help have a more accurate diagnosis. However, the complexity of omics data requires approaches that can capture complex relationships. One way to accomplish this is by exploiting the known regulatory links between the different omics, which could help in constructing a better multimodal representation.In this article, we propose CrossAttOmics, a new deep-learning architecture based on the cross-attention mechanism for multi-omics integration. Each modality is projected in a lower dimensional space with its specific encoder. Interactions between modalities are computed in the feature representation space with cross-attention. Instead of computing the interactions between all the modality pairs, we focused on the known regulatory links between the different omics. The results of different experiments carried out in this paper show that our model can accurately predict the types of cancer by exploiting the interactions between multiple modalities. Our approach can be combined with attribution methods like LRP to identify which interactions are the most important.}},

  abstract  = {{Multimodal deep learning allows data integration from multiple modalities to enhance predictive performances by leveraging the redundancy and complementarity between modalities. Despite the success of deep learning in integrating multimodal data, generating an interpretable multimodal embedding remains challenging. We propose a new multimodal deep-learning architecture that is interpretable by construction. After computing modalities interactions with cross-attention, we used a gating mechanism to score the various interactions. This score allows us to understand the importance of interactions between modalities. This importance score must have enough sparsity to be interpretable and diverse across samples, as modalities interactions differ between samples. We added four regularization terms to ensure the gating scores respect these two properties.This approach can be applied to any multimodal dataset with high-dimensional tabular data. We validate the proposed model on omics datasets in the context of precision medicine to predict patient phenotypes. The gating mechanism improved the accuracy and provided interpretability by selecting the most essential interactions for each patient.}},
